"""
Mechanistic-reasoning scorer (PRD lines 77-84).

Pure functions, NO API key — compares a model's submit_recommendation.mechanism against the
hand-reviewed answer key in mechanism_truth.json across the six PRD dimensions:
clearance pathway, hepatic-vs-renal elimination, CYP/UGT enzymes, transporters, active
metabolites, and protein binding.

Empty lists are scored as correct-negatives (e.g. "no transporter") — the model must get the
ABSENCE right too, not invent entries. Set-valued fields use synonym-normalised set equality;
protein binding is scored within an absolute tolerance.
